Making something that will interface with LED lights to change color based on what the user is listening to.
Plan:
- Get access to Spotify API
- Figure out how to query what a user is listening to
- Get a rating for how "heavy" the song is
- Use that to interface with the lights
- Set up a loop to change the color at certain intervals
